# High Performance Rules Engine - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for developing a high-performance rules code generator system that enables business users to author and execute complex business rules at scale.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Rules DSL (Domain Specific Language)**
   - Simple if-then rule structure
   - Complex boolean conditions with AND, OR, NOT operators
   - Support for nested grouping using parentheses
   - Sequential and conditional step execution

2. **Backend Technology Stack**
   - Java for core engine and code generation
   - ANTLR for grammar parsing and AST generation
   - High-performance compiled rule execution

3. **Frontend Technology Stack**
   - React for rules authoring user interface
   - Intuitive drag-and-drop rule builder
   - Real-time validation and syntax highlighting

## Functional Requirements

### Rules DSL Specification

#### Basic Structure
```
rule: step+
step: IF condition THEN action (ELSE action)?
condition: expression
expression: term ((AND|OR) term)*
term: NOT? (comparison | '(' expression ')')
comparison: attribute operator value
```

#### Rule Components

**Steps**
- Rules consist of one or more steps
- Steps can be executed sequentially or conditionally
- Each step follows if-then-else pattern

**Conditions**
- Support complex boolean expressions
- Operators: AND, OR, NOT
- Nested grouping with parentheses
- Comparison operators: =, !=, <, >, <=, >=, CONTAINS, STARTS_WITH, etc.

**Actions**
- Hundreds of possible actions
- Actions can have parameters
- Support for multiple actions per step

### Scale Requirements

- **Attributes**: Support for 20,000+ attributes
- **Actions**: Support for hundreds of different actions
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond rule execution
- **Concurrency**: Handle thousands of concurrent rule evaluations

## Technical Architecture

### Grammar and Parsing Layer

1. **ANTLR Grammar Definition**
   - Define lexer rules for tokens
   - Define parser rules for rule structure
   - Generate AST for rule representation

2. **AST Node Classes**
   - Rule nodes
   - Step nodes
   - Condition nodes (expressions, terms, comparisons)
   - Action nodes

3. **Parser Implementation**
   - ANTLR-generated lexer and parser
   - Error handling and validation
   - AST construction

### Code Generation Layer

1. **AST Visitor Pattern**
   - Traverse AST for code generation
   - Support multiple output formats
   - Optimization passes

2. **Java Code Generator**
   - Generate optimized Java classes from AST
   - Compile-time optimization
   - Runtime performance focus

### Registry Systems

1. **Attribute Registry**
   - Metadata for 20k+ attributes
   - Type information and validation rules
   - Efficient lookup mechanisms

2. **Action Registry**
   - Catalog of available actions
   - Parameter definitions and validation
   - Action execution framework

### User Interface

1. **Rules Authoring Interface**
   - Visual rule builder
   - Attribute and action browsers
   - Real-time validation
   - Rule testing and debugging

2. **Rule Management**
   - Rule versioning and deployment
   - Rule dependency analysis
   - Performance monitoring

## Performance Requirements

### Execution Performance
- Rule evaluation: < 1ms per rule
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent evaluations
- Memory efficient execution

### Compilation Performance
- Rule compilation: < 100ms per rule
- Batch compilation support
- Incremental compilation for rule updates

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Stateless rule execution
- Efficient resource utilization

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Engine
- ANTLR grammar design and implementation
- AST node classes and parser
- Basic code generation framework

### Phase 2: Code Generation

- Load testing and tuning
- Production deployment features

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**
   - Support all specified DSL features
   - Handle 20k+ attributes and hundreds of actions
   - Generate efficient executable code

2. **Performance**
   - Sub-millisecond rule execution
   - High concurrency support
   - Efficient memory usage

3. **Usability**
   - Intuitive rule authoring interface
   - Comprehensive validation and error handling
   - Effective debugging and testing tools

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clean, modular architecture
   - Comprehensive documentation
