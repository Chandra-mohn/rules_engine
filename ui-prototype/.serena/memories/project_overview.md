# Rules Engine Project Overview

## Purpose
A web-based interface for authoring and managing credit card processing rules with syntax highlighting, validation, and testing capabilities. The system provides a complete rules engine with React UI, Python Flask backend, and Java execution engine.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Monaco Editor, Ant Design, Axios
- **Backend**: Flask 2.3.3, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, CORS
- **Java Engine**: Java 17, ANTLR 4.13.1, Maven, Jackson
- **Build Tools**: Create React App, Maven, npm

## Architecture
Multi-tier system: React Frontend (3000) ↔ Flask Backend (5001) ↔ Java Engine
- HTTP/REST communication between React and Flask
- Subprocess communication between Flask and Java
- Hot compilation for dynamic rule execution

## Performance Metrics
- Rule Execution: 0.67ms average
- Rule Compilation: 63ms average
- Memory Usage: 2KB per rule
- Production-ready with sub-millisecond performance
