2. **Technology Fit**: Appropriate tech stack for each tier
3. **Communication Patterns**: REST APIs with JSON, subprocess for Java integration
4. **Data Flow**: Unidirectional with proper validation layers
5. **Scalability**: Stateless design enables horizontal scaling

**Integration Patterns:**
- ✅ Loose coupling between tiers
- ✅ Proper abstraction layers
- ✅ Error propagation and handling
- ✅ Performance monitoring capabilities

### 🔄 Data Flow Analysis
```
Rule Creation → Frontend Validation → Backend API → Java Compilation → Execution → Results
```

**Validation Strategy**: Multi-layer (3-tier validation)
1. Frontend: Syntax highlighting and basic checks
2. Backend: Parameter validation and business rules
3. Java: ANTLR grammar validation and compilation

## Security Analysis

### 🛡️ Security Assessment - **MODERATE**

**Security Strengths:**
- ✅ No direct database access from frontend
- ✅ Input sanitization for Java code generation
- ✅ Subprocess execution sandboxing
