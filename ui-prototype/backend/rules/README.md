# Rules Data - File-Based Storage

This directory contains business rules stored as JSON files in a hierarchical folder structure.

## Directory Structure

```
rules_data/
├── {client_code}/
│   ├── {process_group_code}/
│   │   ├── {process_area_code}/
│   │   │   ├── rule-{id}.json

├── schema.json          # JSON schema for validation
└── README.md            # This file
```

## Example

```
rules_data/
├── DEMO/
│   ├── CC_STD/
│   │   ├── APPROVAL/
│   │   │   ├── rule-1.json  (creditScoreCheck)
│   │   │   ├── rule-2.json  (ageVerification)

```

## Current Statistics

- **Total Rules**: 33
- **Clients**: 2 (DEMO, PREMIUM)
- **Process Groups**: 6
- **Process Areas**: 6

## Rule File Format

Each rule is stored as a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "creditScoreCheck",
  "description": "Basic credit score validation for standard cards",
  "content": "rule creditScoreCheck:\n    if ...",
  "status": "VALID",
  "item_type": "rule",
  "version": 1,
  "hierarchy": {
    "client_code": "DEMO",
    "process_group_code": "CC_STD",
    "process_area_code": "APPROVAL",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

## Migration

Rules were migrated from SQLite database using:

```bash
python scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_files.py
```

Migration completed successfully with **100% success rate** (33/33 rules).

## Services

### File-Based CRUD Service
`services/rule_file_service.py` - Direct file I/O operations
- **get_rule()** - Read single rule by hierarchy + ID
- **save_rule()** - Create or update rule with validation
- **delete_rule()** - Remove rule file
- **list_rules()** - List rules with optional hierarchy filtering

### Query Service (DuckDB)
`services/rule_query_service.py` - SQL analytics over JSON files
- **find_rules()** - Complex filtering with SQL
- **get_dashboard_stats()** - Aggregated statistics
- **get_rules_by_hierarchy()** - Hierarchical grouping
- **search_rules_by_content()** - Full-text search

## Git Workflow

### Manual Commits (Current Configuration)
1. Edit rules via UI
2. Files are automatically saved to `rules_data/`
3. Manually commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add rules_data/
   git commit -m "Update: creditScoreCheck rule"
   git push
   ```

### Benefits
- **Version Control**: Every change tracked with full git history
- **Collaboration**: Easy sharing via `git pull` / `git push`
- **Diff-Friendly**: Human-readable diffs showing exactly what changed
- **Backup**: Distributed backups across all developer clones
- **Traceability**: Link rule versions to generated code versions

## Schema Validation

All rules are validated against `schema.json` before saving.

### Supported Values
- **Status**: DRAFT, VALID, PEND, SCHD, PROD, deleted
- **Item Types**: rule, actionset, mon_rule, non_mon_rule, action

## Next Steps

To integrate with your Flask application:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install duckdb jsonschema
   ```

2. Use the services in your routes:
   ```python
   from services.rule_file_service import RuleFileService
   from services.rule_query_service import RuleQueryService

   file_service = RuleFileService()
   query_service = RuleQueryService()
   ```

3. Update your routes to use file-based operations instead of SQLite

## Performance

- **File Read**: O(1) - Direct file access by path
- **File Write**: < 100ms for single rule
- **DuckDB Queries**: < 500ms for 1000+ rules
- **No Database Overhead**: No connection pooling, no migrations

## Maintenance

### Backup
Git repository serves as primary backup. Additional backups can be configured via:
- Git remotes (GitHub, GitLab)
- CI/CD automated snapshots
- Cloud storage sync

### Validation
Run validation check:
```bash
python scripts/validate_rules.py
```

### Re-export from SQLite (if needed)
```bash
python scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_files.py
```
